## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `docker-compose up` to start the laugh factory
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to start groaning
## 🐳 Docker

We use Docker to containerize our services, ensuring consistent environments across development and production. Each microservice has its own Dockerfile, and we use docker-compose for orchestration.

To build and run all services:
docker-compose up --build
